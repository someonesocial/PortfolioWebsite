# Portfolio

## Inspiration

Inspired by this [Machine](https://xkcd.com/2916) from xkcd, I thought it could be the basis for a cool background on an interactive portfolio site.
The original uses [Rapier](https://rapier.rs) as the physics engine, but after having problems installing it and its prerequisite ðŸ˜’ I thought it would be cool and educational for me to code the physics from scratch using HTML Canvas. Little did I know that this would quickly turn into a maths and physics project.

## Technical documentation

## Reflection

There were times during development when I wished I had used a physics library. For example, some of the balls would get stuck on the sides because when I was calculating the collision I forgot to include their current velocity, which is added after the check but before the draw function. Bugs like this were time-consuming to diagnose.

## How to work with Vite

### Prerequisites

Have a modern version of Node.installed. Last check was with v20.11

### How to set up

- Open a Terminal in the folder containing the package.json
- Type `npm i` to install the dependencies inside of the project automatically
- Type `npm run dev` into the terminal and see if your files would be compiled correctly
- Take a look at the `index.ts`, the package.json and the `tsconfig.json` file to see how they work
- The `index.ts` file is the entry-point of your application (defined in `rollup.config.js`) - see how it can import other modules
- after you watched how the typescript modules work with each other you can delete all .ts files in the src folder except `index.ts`
- then empty the `index.ts` file and empty the body of your `index.html` file and start building your own app

### Starting the app

- After you did set up your application, run `npm run build` to compile it. If there are no erros, there should be a "build"-folder in your project folder
- take a look at `index.html` - it should already have a script file connected to your TypeScript (The browser can only run JavaScript)
-

Write any source files in typescript inside the source folder, the main file being index.ts as entry file for vite.

run `npm run preview` to preview your executed build
