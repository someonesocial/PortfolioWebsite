# Portfolio

## Inspiration

Inspired by this [Machine](https://xkcd.com/2916) from xkcd, I thought it could be the basis for a cool background on an interactive portfolio site.
The original uses [Rapier](https://rapier.rs) as the physics engine, but after having problems installing it and its prerequisite ðŸ˜’ I thought it would be cool and educational for me to code the physics from scratch using HTML Canvas. Little did I know that this would quickly turn into a maths and physics project.

## Technical Documentation: Canvas-Based Physics Simulation

### Overview

This TypeScript module is designed to simulate the motion and collision of balls within a canvas element in a web browser. It includes gravity and movement toggles, collision detection, and dynamic canvas resizing.

### Module Imports

- DOM Utilities: Provides access to the canvas context (c), and toggle switches for movement and gravity (movement_switch, gravity_switch).
- Utility Functions: Includes functions for generating random numbers within a range (randomFloatFromRange), calculating the distance between two points (distance), and resolving collisions between particles (resolveCollision).
- Styles: A separate CSS file for styling (styles.css).

### Global Variables

- canvas: The HTML canvas element where the simulation runs.
- mouse: An object to track the mouse position on the canvas (during the development i had planned some interactions to be controlled with the mouse, but later decided against it).
- color: The color of the balls in the simulation.
- gravity: A variable to control the gravity effect in the simulation.

### Event Listeners

- Gravity Toggle: Listens for changes on the gravity_switch and updates the gravity variable accordingly.
- Mouse Movement: Updates the mouse object with the current mouse position (currently not used).
- Window Resize: Adjusts the canvas dimensions and re-initializes the simulation.

### Ball Class

Defines the properties and methods for individual balls in the simulation:

- Properties: Position (x, y), velocity, radius, mass, and color.
- Methods:
  - update(): Updates the ballâ€™s position and handles collisions with other balls.
  - draw(): Renders the ball on the canvas.

### Simulation Functions

- calculateNumberOfBalls(): Determines the number of balls to display based on the canvas area.
- init(): Initializes the simulation by creating and positioning the balls.
- animate(): The main animation loop that updates and redraws the balls on each frame.

### Utility Functions

- randomFloatFromRange(min, max): Returns a random floating-point number between min and max.
- distance(x1, y1, x2, y2): Calculates the distance between two points.
- rotate(velocity, angle): Rotates a velocity vector by a given angle.
- resolveCollision(particle, otherParticle): Adjusts the velocities of two colliding particles based on their masses and velocities.

### Collisions with each other

#### Collision Detection:

The collision detection occurs within the update() method of the Ball class.
For each ball, the code checks if it collides with any other ball in the ballArray.
If the distance between the centers of two balls is less than the sum of their radii, a collision is detected.

#### Collision Resolution:

When a collision is detected, the resolveCollision(particle, otherParticle) function is called.
This function adjusts the velocities of the colliding balls based on their masses and initial velocities.
The collision resolution ensures that the balls bounce off each other realistically.

#### Mathematical Underpinnings:

The collision resolution involves concepts from physics and mathematics:

- Conservation of Momentum: The total momentum before and after the collision remains constant.
- Elastic Collision: The collision is assumed to be elastic, meaning kinetic energy is conserved.
- Vector Rotation: Velocities are rotated to a common reference frame to simplify calculations.
- Impulse and Momentum: Impulse (change in momentum) is used to update velocities.

#### Steps in Collision Resolution:

- Calculate the relative velocity vector between the two balls.
- Determine the collision angle (angle of impact) using trigonometry.
- Rotate the velocity vectors of both balls to align with the collision angle.
- Apply the 1D collision equations along this axis (x-direction).
- Rotate the updated velocities back to their original orientation.
- Update the velocities of both balls.

## Reflection

There were times during development when I wished I had used a physics library. For example, some of the balls would get stuck on the sides because when I was calculating the collision I forgot to include their current velocity, which is added after the check but before the draw function. Bugs like this were time-consuming to diagnose.

## How to work with Vite

### Prerequisites

Have a modern version of Node.installed. Last check was with v20.11

### How to set up

- Open a Terminal in the folder containing the package.json
- Type `npm i` to install the dependencies inside of the project automatically
- Type `npm run dev` into the terminal and see if your files would be compiled correctly
- Take a look at the `index.ts`, the package.json and the `tsconfig.json` file to see how they work
- The `index.ts` file is the entry-point of your application (defined in `rollup.config.js`) - see how it can import other modules
- after you watched how the typescript modules work with each other you can delete all .ts files in the src folder except `index.ts`
- then empty the `index.ts` file and empty the body of your `index.html` file and start building your own app

### Starting the app

- After you did set up your application, run `npm run build` to compile it. If there are no erros, there should be a "build"-folder in your project folder
- take a look at `index.html` - it should already have a script file connected to your TypeScript (The browser can only run JavaScript)
-

Write any source files in typescript inside the source folder, the main file being index.ts as entry file for vite.

run `npm run preview` to preview your executed build
